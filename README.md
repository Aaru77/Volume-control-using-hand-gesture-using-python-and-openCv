OpenCV (Open-Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products

We are trying to process a video so that we can control volume of a device with help of its camera using our palm or precisely our thumb and index fingers.

Mediapipe is an open source machine learning library of Google, which has some solutions for face recognition and gesture recognition, and provides encapsulation of python, js and other languages. MediaPipe Hands is a high fidelity hand and finger tracking solution. It uses machine learning (ML) to infer 21 key 3D hand information from just one frame. We can use it to extract the coordinates of the key points of the hand.
